# Numeric matrix processor

# Description

Matrices have a wide range of applications in programming: they're used for digital image processing, graph representation and algorithms on a graph, graphic effects, applied math, statistics, and much more.

Since matrices are tables of numbers, they are usually presented in code as 2D-arrays. In this project, you will learn how to read and output matrices, do operations on them, and compute the determinant of a square matrix. At first, you will work with matrices with integer elements, and later the elements will be floating-point numbers.

# Stage 2/6

In this stage, you are going to implement the multiplication of a matrix by a constant. To do this, you need to multiply every element of the matrix by that constant.
